# Problem
- 1998;S o r e n s e n&H o r i i ,1982)o rap e r - son’s occupation (Russell, Oates, & Greenwood,1998;S m i t h , Gray, Dove, Kirchner, & Heras,1997): Chronic vocal fatigue, voice loss, and other voice problems are, for example, frequently reported for teachers, singers, and other occupations requiring intense voice use (Williams, 2003).
- The face perception literature has already highlighted the need to study within-person variability: within-person variability in faces is substantial and the challenges it poses for face identity perception have been described in a number of studies (e.g., Burton, 2013; Jenkins, White, Montfort, & Burton, 2011).
- It further remains unclear to what extent a listener can overcome the challenges of variability– that is, can perceptual representations of highly familiar voices (e.g., partners, parents) be sufficiently specified to allow full generalization even to entirely novel vocalizations?
- Intriguingly, studies have also highlighted that within-person variability may not always pose challenges to viewers but may indeed be essential for learning new identities (Burton, Kramer, Ritchie & Jenkins,2016; Murphy, Ipser, Gaigg & Cook, 2015; Ritchie & Burton, 2017).

# Method Summary
- The validity of this approach was, however, largely dismissed as a result of studies showing poor matching across voice prints from variable vocal signals (e.g., disguised voices) – furthermore, at the time there were prohibitive technical limitations on performing the required large-scale acoustic analyses due to a lack of suitable computing resources (Hollien, 2002).
- It should, however, be noted that while quantifying within-person variability in voices may be possible, it is unclear if and how such computational representations of voices relate to human identity perception: algorithms may include acoustic features in their computations that are not perceptually salient and therefore non-diagnostic to human listeners.
- That is, the nature and scale of within-person vocal variability renders insufficient any model of vocal identity that represents the individual as a point within an acoustic space – yet such an approach, prioritizing between- over withinperson cues, has provided the conceptual backdrop to the vast majority of existing literature on voice identity.
- In this paper, we propose that we need to extend the focus of voice-identity research to account for both Btelling people together^ as well as Btelling people apart.^ That is, we must account for whether, and to what extent, listeners can overcome within-person variability to obtain a stable percept of person identity from vocal cues.
- While the voice perception literature has, and will continue, to greatly benefit from taking established methods and paradigms from the face-perception literature to probe novel questions in the auditory domain, it cannot be assumed that faces and voices are perceived in similar ways at all processing stages.
- We therefore argue that the study of within-person variability not only opens up exciting new avenues of research, but that it is, in fact, essential to account for the varied effects of withinperson variability in theoretical and methodological frameworks applied to voice-identity perception.
- Given the large within-person variability in vocal signals, computational approaches may be able to formally establish whether within-person variability is truly personspecific and, if this is the case, describe the nature of this variability (see Burton et al., 2016 for faces).

  - It could therefore be argued that in order to have a comprehensive and robust representation of a person ’si d e n t i t yf r o m their voice alone, a listener needs to have a wide experience of that person ’s vocal repertoire, including speech in different contexts, and non-verbal vocalizations of different types (affective, such as laughter and crying, and non-affective, such as coughing).
- Avoid when:
  - The robustness and stability of a representation are likely linked to the type of familiarity with a voice (e.g., personally/intimately familiar vs. famous voices, see Kreiman & Sidtis,2011), the type and duration of exposure (e.g., passive exposure vs. active interactions; variable settings vs. fairly uniform settings) and other factors (e.g., whether we like/dislike a person).
  - The validity of this approach was, however, largely dismissed as a result of studies showing poor matching across voice prints from variable vocal signals (e.g., disguised voices) – furthermore, at the time there were prohibitive technical limitations on performing the required large-scale acoustic analyses due to a lack of suitable computing resources (Hollien, 2002).
- Failure modes:
  - V ariations in the anatomy of each individual’s vocal apparatus, such as the thickness of the vocal folds, differences in the shape of a person ’s palate, and the dynamic use of the vocal tract, give rise to differences in pronunciation, accent and other idiosyncratically marked features of a person’s vocal inventory (see Scott & McGettigan,2015, for a review).
