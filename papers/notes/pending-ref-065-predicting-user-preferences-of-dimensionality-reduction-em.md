# Problem
- A major contribution of this paper is its overview of the research and development efforts that have been endeavoured in the field, and the challenges that tourism researchers are, and will be, facing.

# Method Summary
- This project is partly supported by a grant funded by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (G-U436).
- Tourism Management Reviews ABSTRACT This paper reviews the published articles on eTourism in the past 20 years.
- Using a wide variety of sources, mainly in the tourism liter ature, this paper comprehensively reviews and analyzes prior studies in the context of Intern et applications to Tourism.

- A major contribution of this paper is its overview of the research and development efforts that have been endeavoured in the field, and the challenges that tourism researchers are, and will be, facing.
- Keywords: Internet, eTourism, eBusiness, tourism management and marketing INTRODUCTION Technological progress and tourism have been going hand in hand for years (Sheldon, 1997; Poon, 1993).
- Since the 1980s, Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been transforming tourism globally.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Developments in search engines, carrying capacity and speed of networks have influenced the number of travellers around the world that use technologies for planning and experiencing their travels.
  - The establishment of the Computer Reservations Systems (CRSs) in the 1970s and Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) in the late 1980s, followed by the development of the Internet in the late 1990s, have transformed the best operational and strategic practices in the industry dramatically (Buhalis, 2003; O’Connor, 1999; Emmer et al,, 1993; eBusiness Watch, 2006).
- Avoid when:
  - In April 2007 to January 2008, online databases of Sc ienceDirect and EBSCOHost’s tourism and hospitality index, as well as the Google Scholar search engine were used to search for related articles, mainly in the tourism literature, using different combinations of keywords that are related to eTourism.
