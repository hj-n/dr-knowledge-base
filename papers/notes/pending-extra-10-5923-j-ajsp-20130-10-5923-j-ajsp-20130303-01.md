# Problem
- 7 shows that it was difficult to recognize utterances of articulation disorders using a n acoustic model trained by utterances of physically unimpaired persons.
- It is believed that this difficulty causes fluctuations in spea king style and degradation of the recognition rates.
- Therefore, athetoid symptoms occur and articulation becomes difficult.

# Method Summary
- In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method based on RP (Random Projection) for dysarthric speech recognition.
- These methods improved the recognition accuracy, but the performance for articulation disorders was 42 Toshiya Y oshioka et al.: Evaluation of Random-Projection-Based Feature Combination on Dysarthric Speech Recognition not sufficient when compared to that of persons with no disability.
- Experiment 3 In order to show the superiority of the RP -based feature projection method, in Experiment 3, we compared the proposed method and the PCA -based feature projection method.
- Experiment 2 The aim of Experiment 2 is to evaluate the improvement introduced by the use of a RP -based feature projection method for the unstable 1st utterance.
- We can see that the combination of random projection and ROVER outperforms both t he baseline method (MFCCs) and the PCA -based feature extraction method.
- It represents a computationally simple method that approximately preserves the Euclidean distance of any two points through the projection.
- C omparison between the PCA-based featu re projection method and the results ob tained by our proposed method for the 1st u tterance 5.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Therefore, we recorded speech data for persons with articulation disorders who uttered each of the words several times, and investigated the influence of the unstable speaking style caused by the athe toid symptoms.
  - Also, [11] used MAF (multiple acoustic frames) as an acoustic dynamic feature to improve the recognition rate of a person with articul ation disorders, especially in speech recognition using dynamic features only.
- Avoid when:
  - It is considered that the speaker experiences a more strained state du ring the first utterance compared to subsequent utterances because the first utterance is t he first intentional movement.
  - In contrast to conven tional techniques such as PCA, which find a subspace by optimizing certain criteria, random projection does not use such criteria; therefore, it is data independent.
- Failure modes:
  - That means, in the case of speaking -related movements, the first utterance is often unstable or unclear due to the athetoid sympt oms, and that causes degradation of speech recognition.

# Metrics Mentioned
- No explicit named metric was extracted from this source; combine this source with complementary DR quality checks in workflow Step 3.

# Implementation Notes
- Random projection is applied to MFC C at the th-t frame,   12Rx t , and the new feature,   12Ry t , is obtained:      tt l xy T P (2) Then, the new feature also has the delta parameter o f original feature,  tx .
- The goal of front -end speech processing in ASR is to obtain a projection of the speech signal to a compact parameter space where the information related to speech content can be extracted.
- Each system was trained using 24 -dimensional feature vectors consisting of 12 -dimensional MFCC parameters, along with their delta parameters.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
