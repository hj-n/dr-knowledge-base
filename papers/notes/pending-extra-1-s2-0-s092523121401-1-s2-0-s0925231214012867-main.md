# Problem
- The accuracy, in terms of neighborhood preservation, is con ﬁrmed by a set of comparisons and tests, showing that LoCH is capable of successfully segregating groups of similar instances embedded in high-dimensional sparse spaces and of de ﬁning the borders between them, signi ﬁcantly better than most projection techniques. & 2014 Elsevier B.V.
- Our technique, LoCH, is tailored to handle high-dimensional sparse spaces, so differently from global techniques, we seek to preserve neighborhood distance structures.
- PLP handles this problem by solving several small Laplacian operators, but inducing the creation of artiﬁcial sub-groups that may not exist on the dataset.
- When the purpose is neighborhood preservation, local techniques are preferable, specially when handling high-dimensional sparse spaces.

# Method Summary
- Chalmers' algorithm has been further improved, reaching complexitiesO ð ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ n54p Þ [20] and Oðn log nÞ [21] u s i n gas a m p l i n ga n d interpolation approach, but decreasing the precision on preserving local distances structures.
- Neurocomputing 150 (2015) 546 –556 Following we present related techniques categorized into global and local approaches, detail the LoCH technique, show the comparative analysis and ﬁnish outlining our conclusions.
- abstract On the last few years multidimensional projection techniques have advanced towards de ﬁning faster and user-centered approaches.
- The Local Af ﬁne Multidimensional Projection (LAMP) technique [28] is one example of a hybrid global and local approach.
- Other local approaches have been proposed, for instance, Local Linear Embedding (LLE)[22] and ISOMAP [23].
- Random Projection [18] is another example of an O(n) approach.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Kumar, A comparison of document clustering techniques, in: 6th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Data Mining (KDD'00), Workshop on Text Mining, ACM, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, 2000, pp.
  - Albeit the advances on the last few years towards creating techniques that could handle large datasets on almost interactive rates, or user-centered techniques that allow the ﬁne tuning of ﬁnal layouts [8],m o s to ft h e ma r e designed as generic tools without considering particular features of the data under processing, such as the distance distribution when the data is embedded into a certain metric space.
- Avoid when:
  - In order to overcome such limitation, while keeping a good quality in terms of distance preservation, Landmarks MDS (LMDS) [12],P i v o t MDS [13], and Pekalska's approach [14] employ similar strategies where a small sample of instances is initially projected and the remaining ones are interpolated on the ﬁnal layout.
  - If compared to the local techniques, LoCH presents the best trade-off between computational time and precision, in terms of neighborhood preservation, being very simple to implement, not involving linear systems, optimization process or eigendecomposition solvers as most techniques.
- Failure modes:
  - Paulovich et al. [25] proposed a technique called Least Square Projection (LSP) that uses a force-based scheme to ﬁrst position a subset of samples and then map the remaining instances through a Laplacian-like operator that seeks to map each instance close to its nearest neighbors.
