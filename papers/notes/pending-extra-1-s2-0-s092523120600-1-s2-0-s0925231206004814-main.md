# Problem
- Keywords: Exploratory data analysis; Continuous projection; High-dimensional data; Distortion visualization; Uncertainty visualization; Topology recovering; Delaunay graph; Voronoı¨cells 1.
- Therefore, measuring and visualizing these distortions is crucial for the analyst to detect which pairwise distances have been preserved, hence to evaluate whether the features observed in the projection space are faithful images of some features in the original space, or artifacts of the projection.
- Geometrical and topological distortions projecting E to F: compression (a) and stretching (b) correspond to geometrical distortions where t he relative distances between original neighboring data have changed but not enough to modify the neighborhood structure itself.
- Measuring and visualizing the distortions A large number of distortion measures and associated visualization techniques have been proposed for the selforganizing map [15,36], either based on coloring the units of the map, or some region around them.

# Method Summary
- 1 Although many other continuous projection techniques exist in the literature, we present here the application of our visualization methods with the PCA and the CCA (without the vector quantization scheme) because they lead to very different projections of the same data allowing us to demonstrate the generality of our approach.
- In order to evaluate this faithfulness, we propose to visualize any measure associated to a projected datum or to a pair of projected data, by coloring the corresponding Voronoı ¨ cell in the projection space.
- Both these measures are useful to compare different projection methods, or to compare two projections performed using the same method in case where multiple optima exist.
- Therefore, measuring and visualizing these distortions is crucial for the analyst to detect which pairwise distances have been preserved, hence to evaluate whether the features observed in the projection space are faithful images of some features in the original space, or artifacts of the projection.
- However, in general, the projection techniques lead to a loss of information through the stretching or the compression of most of the pairwise distances because the dimension of the space spanned by the original data is generally higher than the dimension of the projection space.
- Some measures deal speciﬁcally with continuous projection techniques such as the Shepard diagram [16] which consists in displaying pairs of data by points having the original pairwise distance as x coordinate and the projection pairwise distance as y coordinate.
- Abstract The visualization of continuous multi-dimensional data based on their projection to a 2-dimensional space is a way to detect visually interesting patterns, as far as the projection provides a faithful image of the original data.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Note that the bright cells in the segment-compression (7d) and triangle-compression ( 7g) views are not in the same area as in the point-compression view ( 7c) because the former show the compression of each single Delaunay segment or triangle, while the latter shows the mean compression of each point w.r.t. all the other points.
  - 1 Although many other continuous projection techniques exist in the literature, we present here the application of our visualization methods with the PCA and the CCA (without the vector quantization scheme) because they lead to very different projections of the same data allowing us to demonstrate the generality of our approach.
- Avoid when:
  - However, in general, the projection techniques lead to a loss of information through the stretching or the compression of most of the pairwise distances because the dimension of the space spanned by the original data is generally higher than the dimension of the projection space.
  - The left (resp, right) sphere–cylinder intersection is made of either one connected component which is the left (resp. right) ring, or two separate connected components one of which is the left (resp. right) ring because we know each ring is connected.
- Failure modes:
  - We remember this is extremely important because that means we can draw no conclusion from any projection without having an additional information (here we draw conclusion from the fact we performed a linear projection) or any measure of its quality.

# Implementation Notes
- In order to evaluate this faithfulness, we propose to visualize any measure associated to a projected datum or to a pair of projected data, by coloring the corresponding Voronoı ¨ cell in the projection space.
- Both these measures are useful to compare different projection methods, or to compare two projections performed using the same method in case where multiple optima exist.

- However, in general, the projection techniques lead to a loss of information through the stretching or the compression of most of the pairwise distances because the dimension of the space spanned by the original data is generally higher than the dimension of the projection space.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
