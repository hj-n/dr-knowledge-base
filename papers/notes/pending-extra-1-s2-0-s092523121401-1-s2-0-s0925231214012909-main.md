# Problem
- They de ﬁne a perceptually uniform 2D color coding of the projection area that allows observers to detect the presence of geometrical mapping distortions such as tears – when neighboring data instances are mapped far apart – and false neighborhoods – when distant ones are mapped close.
- Earlier work by Aupetit [15] introduced measures of outliers and other projection artifacts, as well as an approach to visualize projection distortions by overlaying quality measures on a Voronoi cell decomposition of the 2D projection mapping.
- In order to overcome this problem, they propose replacing the ﬁxed neighborhoods by one that considers a probability distribution for all points, adopting a control variable to ensure that the probability decays as the distance increases.
- The work by Sedlmair et al. [17] tackles this problem, introducing a taxonomy of visual cluster separation factors in projection scatter plots, which is given as a guide to evaluate cluster separability measures.

# Method Summary
- It is important to stress that the measures proposed are meant to evaluate 2D mappings generated by multidimensional projections for visualization purposes, and not as an approach to evaluate general dimension reduction techniques, aimed at obtaining lower-dimensional embeddings that characterize a non-linear manifold in which the data would lie.
- In this paper we propose a unifying framework to derive objective measures of thelocal behavior of projection mappings that support interpreting the mappings and comparing solutions regarding several properties.
- Earlier work by Aupetit [15] introduced measures of outliers and other projection artifacts, as well as an approach to visualize projection distortions by overlaying quality measures on a Voronoi cell decomposition of the 2D projection mapping.
- Current methods to assess projection quality fail to capture properties that are paramount to user interpretation, such as the capability of conveying class information, or the preservation of groups and neighborhoods from the original space.
- Our graph-based framework thus avoids several of the shortcomings mentioned above and introduces a novel approach to measuring projection quality that is potentially useful both to enhance their interpretation and to assess their reliability.
- This approach is limited in that a clustering model extracted by a particular algorithm is not necessarily faithful to the data, and moreover intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships are largely ignored.
- Some quantitative measures that support objective assessments of the global or local behavior of projection mappings regarding distinct properties are reviewed and discussed in Section 2 .

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Our graph-based framework thus avoids several of the shortcomings mentioned above and introduces a novel approach to measuring projection quality that is potentially useful both to enhance their interpretation and to assess their reliability.
  - Measures derived from the co-ranking framework suffer from the same limitations of other approaches based on K-neighborhoods computed either from distances or ranks: by ﬁxing neighborhood sizes a priori one ignores that the number of relevant neighbors is likely to vary across the data set and K should vary accordingly to capture these local properties.
- Avoid when:
  - These measures can be weighted into a single measure for a combined quantitative evaluation. precisionðiÞ¼ NTP;i ki ¼ 1/C0 NFP;i ki ð2Þ recallðiÞ¼ NTP;i ri ¼ 1/C0 NMISS;i ri ð3Þ Authors highlight that considering ﬁxed-size neighborhoods causes all neighborhood violations to be equally penalized.

- Failure modes:
  - Projections are usually displayed as 2D scatter plots and support visual analysis in a wide variety of applications, typically requiring users to identify similarity of individuals in a class or cluster, as well as outliers based on proximity [6–9].

- `stress`: referenced as part of projection-quality or reliability assessment.

- `rank-based quality criteria`: referenced as part of projection-quality or reliability assessment.

# Implementation Notes
- Stress functions are a classical measure of the distance preservation capability of projections, e.g., Morrison and Chalmers [1 1] use stress to compare projections obtained with various techniques and varying parameters.
- Nonetheless, their usage poses many practical issues, e.g., which technique would handle the data better, which is the best parameterization, how reliable is the data mapping, or yet how to interpret a perceived pattern.
- Additionally, good parameter values may depend on data characteristics unknown to the analyst, for example, users are often required to set distance thresholds or neighborhood sizes.
- They further suggest an improved parameterization of the quality measures Qlocal and Qglobal to ensure better control of the evaluation focus and a more ﬁne-grained analysis.
- The measures introduced in this paper rely on connectivity patterns identiﬁed on a graph model that does not require setting neighborhood sizes or other parameters.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
