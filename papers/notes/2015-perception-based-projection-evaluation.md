# Problem
- Projection quality is often judged algorithmically, but user-perceived task performance can diverge from mathematical quality assumptions.
- Little evidence existed about which projections support which visualization tasks under realistic user conditions.
- The paper addresses this by perception-based controlled evaluation over multiple task families.

# Method Summary
- The authors run a controlled user study with layouts generated by five representative projection techniques.
- They define eight abstract tasks grouped into segregation, precision, and visual-clutter categories.
- Hypotheses test task dependence, data dependence, and user preference relations to projection characteristics.
- Statistical analysis compares objective task outcomes, confidence, and completion time.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when selecting projection methods for human-in-the-loop analysis rather than purely computational objectives.
- Use when you need evidence that method performance differs by task type and data characteristics.
- Avoid one-method-fits-all assumptions across segregation, distance, and clutter-sensitive tasks.
- Failure mode: selecting a projection by algorithm reputation without testing target user tasks.

# Metrics Mentioned
- Task-oriented user-performance signals (accuracy/time/confidence) are treated as primary evaluation outputs.
- The framework separates segregation, distance-preservation, and clutter-related quality goals.
- It supports multi-criteria evaluation rather than a single scalar quality metric.

# Implementation Notes
- Align method selection with the concrete human task set before presenting embeddings to analysts.
- When evaluating methods internally, include at least one task from each relevant category (segregation/precision/clutter).
- Report both objective performance and subjective confidence because they may diverge.
- Use this evidence to justify task-specific projection defaults in workflow documentation.

# Claim Atoms (For Conflict Resolution)
- CLAIM-PERC15-C1 | stance: support | summary: Projection effectiveness is task-dependent and data-dependent from a user perspective. | evidence_ids: PERC15-E1, PERC15-E2
- CLAIM-PERC15-C2 | stance: support | summary: Different task families require different projection strengths (segregation, precision, clutter). | evidence_ids: PERC15-E3, PERC15-E4
- CLAIM-PERC15-C3 | stance: support | summary: Controlled user studies provide necessary evidence beyond algorithm-only comparison. | evidence_ids: PERC15-E5, PERC15-E6

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 1 | relevance: medium | note: reinforces task clarification before method recommendation.
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: supports task-dependent technique selection.
- step: 5 | relevance: high | note: links visual clutter and perception constraints to rendering decisions.
- step: 6 | relevance: medium | note: strengthens user-facing explanation with task-study evidence.
