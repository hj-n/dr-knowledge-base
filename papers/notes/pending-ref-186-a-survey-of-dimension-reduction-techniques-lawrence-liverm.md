# Problem
- Gene modeling was performed using a combination of homology and ab initio methods, selecting a single gene model for each locus (see Methods).
- The calculation of syntenic blocks is described in Methods.

# Method Summary
- Gene modeling was performed using a combination of homology and ab initio methods, selecting a single gene model for each locus (see Methods).
- The calculation of syntenic blocks is described in Methods.
- Genome sequencing and analysis of the biomass-degrading fungus Trichoderma reesei (syn.
- We assembled 89 scaffolds (sets of ordered and oriented contigs) to generate 34 Mbp of nearly contiguous T. reesei genome sequence comprising 9,129 predicted gene models.
- Unexpectedly, considering the industrial utility and effectiveness of the carbohydrate-active enzymes of T. reesei, its genome encodes fewer cellulases and hemicellulases than any other sequenced fungus able to hydrolyze plant cell wall polysaccharides.
- Many T. reesei genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are distributed nonrandomly in clusters that lie between regions of synteny with other Sordariomycetes.
- Numerous genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites may promote survival of T. reesei in its competitive soil habitat, but genome analysis provided little mechanistic insight into its extraordinary capacity for protein secretion.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Although replacement of gasoline with cellulosic ethanol may substantially reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and decrease global warming4, the high cost of hydrolyzing biomass polysaccharides to fermentable sugars remains a major obstacle that must be overcome before cellulosic ethanol can be effectively commercialized.
  - 6,329 ﬁnishing reads were created with custom primers from the 3-kb and 8-kb libraries to close a majority of the gaps, and the Phred/Phrap/Consed software package was then used to assemble 89 scaffolds and 97 contigs totaling B34 Mb.
- Avoid when:
  - Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina ) is a mesophilic soft-rot ascomycete fungus that is widely used in industry as a source of cellulases and hemicellulases for the hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides.
  - All of the genetic markers that were used in the three studies were recovered, as were all protein and RNA sequences in the current release of GenBank (version 161.0).
- Failure modes:
  - It has enjoyed a long history of safe use for industrial enzyme production 3 and as an important model system for studying lignocellulose degradation.

# Implementation Notes
- The calculation of syntenic blocks is described in Methods.
- Genome sequencing and analysis of the biomass-degrading fungus Trichoderma reesei (syn.

- Unexpectedly, considering the industrial utility and effectiveness of the carbohydrate-active enzymes of T. reesei, its genome encodes fewer cellulases and hemicellulases than any other sequenced fungus able to hydrolyze plant cell wall polysaccharides.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
