# Problem
- Visual analytics papers frequently use t-SNE/UMAP for tasks requiring faithful global distance or density structure, despite known local-method limits.
- This mismatch creates convincing but invalid interpretations (for example, reading cluster distance or density from layouts that do not preserve them reliably).
- The paper treats misuse as a socio-technical problem: method mismatch is amplified by weak reasoning practices, popularity bias, and low-friction but misleading recommendations.

# Method Summary
- The work reviews 136 visual-analytics papers to quantify where DR technique usage aligns or misaligns with analytic tasks.
- It organizes DR usage into seven task categories and compares those task needs to local-technique behavior (t-SNE/UMAP) versus global-technique behavior (PCA/MDS).
- It complements the literature review with interviews:
  - practitioner interviews to identify why misuse persists in real workflows,
  - DR-expert interviews to explain why previous educational efforts were insufficient.
- The paper reports repeated misuse growth over time and frames corrective guidance around task-first method selection rather than defaulting to popular techniques.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use local techniques (t-SNE/UMAP) when the primary goal is local structure analysis:
  - neighborhood identification,
  - outlier identification,
  - cluster identification.
- Use global techniques (PCA/MDS family) for global-geometry tasks:
  - point-distance investigation,
  - class-separability investigation,
  - cluster-distance investigation,
  - cluster-density investigation.
- Do not use t-SNE/UMAP as a one-size-fits-all default for every DR question.
- Do not accept recommendations justified only by popularity or anecdotal convention.
- Failure mode: manually tuning parameters to get visually separated clusters without task-level validity checks can produce persuasive but unreliable findings.

# Metrics Mentioned
- The paper is task-mismatch centered and does not propose one universal metric objective.
- It repeatedly stresses faithfulness-to-task as the evaluation principle: metric and method choices should be selected for the declared analytical question.
- In KB terms, this paper primarily anchors task clarification and task-aligned technique selection, while downstream metric selection should remain task-conditional and evidence-backed.

# Implementation Notes
- Enforce task confirmation before method ranking. If intent is ambiguous, ask one clarification question before presenting candidate methods.
- Keep recommendation logic explicit:
  - local-task goals -> start from local-preserving methods,
  - global-geometry goals -> start from global-preserving methods.
- Require explicit priority when users ask for multiple goals in one run; avoid silent multi-objective compromise without agreement.
- Require reasoning quality checks in final reporting: references should justify method-task fit, not only method familiarity.
- Treat visually pleasing layouts as insufficient evidence unless reliability checks and task alignment are both satisfied.

- CLAIM-JEON25-C2 | stance: support | summary: DR analytic tasks can be divided into seven categories for task-first guidance. | evidence_ids: JEON25-E3
- CLAIM-JEON25-C3 | stance: support | summary: t-SNE/UMAP align with local tasks (neighborhood/outlier/cluster identification). | evidence_ids: JEON25-E4
- CLAIM-JEON25-C4 | stance: support | summary: PCA/MDS better align with global pairwise-distance-driven tasks including point/cluster distance and density questions. | evidence_ids: JEON25-E5, JEON25-E6
- CLAIM-JEON25-C5 | stance: support | summary: Misuse is reinforced by weak rationale and recommendation dynamics beyond pure method mechanics. | evidence_ids: JEON25-E7, JEON25-E8, JEON25-E9

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 1 | relevance: high | note: establishes task-first confirmation as the main guard against misuse.
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: provides direct task-to-technique family alignment (local-focused vs global-focused).
- step: 4 | relevance: medium | note: supports deterministic exclusion of method families that contradict the confirmed goal.
- step: 7 | relevance: high | note: requires final justification to explain why method choice matches task intent and reliability limits.
