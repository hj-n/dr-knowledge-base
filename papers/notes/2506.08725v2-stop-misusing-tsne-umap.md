# Problem
- Practitioners often use t-SNE/UMAP for analytical tasks that these methods do not support well.
- This causes misleading conclusions in visual analytics.

# Method Summary
- The paper reviews 136 papers and categorizes DR usage patterns.
- It defines 7 analytical tasks for DR usage.
- It evaluates alignment between task types and DR technique families (local vs global).

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use local techniques (t-SNE/UMAP) for:
  - Neighborhood identification
  - Outlier identification
  - Cluster identification
- Avoid using local techniques as default for:
  - Point distance investigation
  - Class separability investigation
  - Cluster distance investigation
  - Cluster density investigation
- Prefer global techniques (PCA/MDS) for the four global tasks above.

# Metrics Mentioned
- The paper discusses task suitability and faithfulness rather than prescribing one universal metric.
- It emphasizes matching evaluation criteria to analytical task type.

# Implementation Notes
- Intake step should force the user to choose one primary analytical task first.
- Method-family recommendation should follow task alignment:
  - local tasks -> t-SNE/UMAP family
  - global tasks -> PCA/MDS family
- If users request multiple tasks, require explicit prioritization.

# Claim Atoms (For Conflict Resolution)
- CLAIM-TASK-7-TAXONOMY | stance: support | summary: DR analytic tasks can be categorized into seven groups | evidence_ids: JEON25-E1
- CLAIM-TECH-LOCAL-TSNE-UMAP | stance: support | summary: t-SNE/UMAP are suitable for neighborhood, outlier, and cluster identification tasks | evidence_ids: JEON25-E2
- CLAIM-TECH-GLOBAL-PCA-MDS | stance: support | summary: PCA/MDS are more suitable for point-distance, class-separability, cluster-distance, and cluster-density tasks | evidence_ids: JEON25-E3, JEON25-E4, JEON25-E5, JEON25-E6

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 1 | relevance: high | note: Establishes the 7-task axis as mandatory precondition before method recommendation.
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: Provides direct task-to-technique alignment (local tasks vs global tasks).
- step: 7 | relevance: high | note: Final explanation should explicitly connect selected methods to the declared task axis.
