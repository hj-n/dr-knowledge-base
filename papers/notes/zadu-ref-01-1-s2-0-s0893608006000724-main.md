# Problem
- In visualization-oriented DR, methods must trade off two opposite error types: false neighbors in projection (trustworthiness loss) and missing original neighbors in projection (continuity loss).
- The paper studies this tradeoff directly rather than assuming one-sided neighborhood quality.
- It also examines how distance modeling choices (Euclidean vs geodesic approximations) affect neighborhood fidelity.

# Method Summary
- The paper introduces **local MDS** as an extension of CCA to explicitly control trustworthiness vs continuity through a tunable parameter `λ`.
- It compares local MDS with established DR methods (Isomap, LLE, Laplacian Eigenmaps, SNE, CCA variants) on toy and real high-dimensional datasets.
- The method’s objective modifies neighborhood penalties in both input and output spaces, making the tradeoff user-controllable.
- It reports practical `λ` behavior and recommends moderate values for stable tradeoffs under Euclidean distances.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - neighborhood-structure reliability is the main goal,
  - you need explicit control over trustworthiness-continuity tradeoff,
  - you want to inspect sensitivity of local-structure fidelity to distance modeling.
- Avoid when:
  - you need a single globally optimal closed-form embedding without iterative optimization.
- Failure modes:
  - extreme tradeoff settings can over-optimize one side (trustworthiness or continuity) and severely damage the other.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `tnc`: trustworthiness/continuity concept is central to the method objective and evaluation.

# Implementation Notes
- The paper’s comparisons run multiple random initializations and select best runs under a fixed evaluation criterion.
- The geodesic-distance variant can improve or degrade results depending on data manifold/connectivity assumptions.
- Empirical guidance in the paper suggests moderate `λ` ranges for balanced behavior in Euclidean-distance settings.

- CLAIM-ZR01-C1 | stance: support | summary: Visualization DR requires explicit compromise between trustworthiness and continuity. | evidence_ids: ZR01-E1, ZR01-E2
- CLAIM-ZR01-C2 | stance: support | summary: Local MDS extends CCA with a user-tunable parameter to control trustworthiness-continuity tradeoff. | evidence_ids: ZR01-E3, ZR01-E4
- CLAIM-ZR01-C3 | stance: support | summary: Distance modeling choice (Euclidean vs geodesic) materially changes neighborhood-fidelity outcomes. | evidence_ids: ZR01-E5, ZR01-E6

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: provides direct rationale for selecting local-neighborhood reliability checks.
- step: 4 | relevance: medium | note: informs tradeoff-aware ranking when neighborhood fidelity is primary.
- step: 6 | relevance: high | note: provides tunable parameter guidance for trustworthiness/continuity balancing.
