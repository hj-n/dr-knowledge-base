# Problem
- In a visualization task, every nonlinear projection method needs to make a compromise between trustworthiness and continuity.
- In a trustworthy projection the visualized proximities hold in the original data as well, whereas a continuous projection visualizes all proximities of the original data.

# Method Summary
- We show experimentally that one of the multidimensional scaling methods, curvilinear components analysis, is good at maximizing trustworthiness.
- Box 5400, FI-02015 TKK, Finland Abstract In a visualization task, every nonlinear projection method needs to make a compromise between trustworthiness and continuity.
- We then extend it to focus on local proximities both in the input and output space, and to explicitly make a user-tunable parameterized compromise between trustworthiness and continuity.
- These errors decrease the trustworthiness of the visualization, as they create neighborhood relationships that are not present in the data.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Use when selecting DR reliability checks in workflow Step 3.
  - Use with complementary local/cluster/global metrics rather than a single score.
- Avoid when:
  - Avoid using this source as the only decision signal without task constraints.
- Failure modes:
  - Overfitting conclusions to a single metric family or benchmark setup.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `tnc`: local neighborhood trustworthiness/continuity balance

# Implementation Notes
- Keep preprocessing and seed policy fixed before comparing reliability scores across methods.
- Use this source with at least one complementary note before final recommendation text.
