# Problem
- The paper addresses the lack of a unified framework for comparing DR quality criteria, especially neighborhood-rank-based metrics.
- It argues that rank-based criteria capture local structure behavior differently from classical stress-based distance criteria.
- The goal is to formalize quality interpretation through co-ranking analysis and derive interpretable quality/behavior indicators.

# Method Summary
- The paper introduces co-ranking-matrix-based analysis as a unifying representation of rank preservation errors.
- It reinterprets established metrics (Trustworthiness/Continuity, LCMC, MRRE) as weighting different co-ranking blocks.
- It proposes additional indicators that separate overall quality from distortion behavior (intrusion-vs-extrusion tendencies).
- It validates these criteria on synthetic and real datasets and compares how different DR methods express different error patterns.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - you need local rank-preservation diagnostics across neighborhood scales,
  - you want interpretable decomposition of neighborhood errors,
  - you are comparing methods that can look similar under one scalar but differ in error type.
- Avoid when:
  - your target metric is purely global metric-distance fit only.
- Failure modes:
  - single weighted criteria can hide antagonistic behaviors; co-ranking decomposition is needed to expose them.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `tnc`: formalized as weighted co-ranking penalties for intrusions/extrusions.
- `mrre`: rank-error criteria related to T&C but with different weighting and emphasis.
- `lcmc`: overlap-based local criterion with baseline correction, interpretable in the same co-ranking framework.
- `stress`: presented as older distance-preservation criterion with different focus than rank-based local criteria.

# Implementation Notes
- Evaluate criteria as curves over neighborhood size `K` instead of a single point whenever possible.
- Keep rank construction and distance policy fixed across candidates for comparability.
- Co-ranking matrix interpretation helps detect if one method favors intrusion reduction at the cost of extrusion growth (or vice versa).

# Claim Atoms (For Conflict Resolution)
- CLAIM-ZR02-C1 | stance: support | summary: The paper introduces a co-ranking matrix framework to unify rank-based DR quality criteria. | evidence_ids: ZR02-E1, ZR02-E2
- CLAIM-ZR02-C2 | stance: support | summary: T&C, MRRE, and LCMC correspond to different block/weight emphases in co-ranking analysis. | evidence_ids: ZR02-E3, ZR02-E4
- CLAIM-ZR02-C3 | stance: support | summary: Rank-based criteria reveal quality-behavior differences that are not captured by classical stress criteria alone. | evidence_ids: ZR02-E5, ZR02-E6

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: directly supports local-rank metric selection.
- step: 4 | relevance: high | note: supports multi-criterion scoring with explicit intrusion/extrusion behavior interpretation.
- step: 6 | relevance: medium | note: enables scale-aware (`K`) evaluation during tuning.
