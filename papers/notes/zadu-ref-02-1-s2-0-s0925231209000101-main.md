# Problem
- Dimensionality reduction aims at providing low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data sets.
- Many new nonlinear methods have been proposed for the last years, yet the question of their assessment and comparison remains open.

# Method Summary
- More recently, new criteria for quality assessment have been proposed, with a broader applicability, such as the trustworthiness and continuity (T&C) measures [37], the local continuity meta- criterion (LCMC) [6], and the mean relative rank errors (MRREs) [22].

- This paper ﬁrst reviews some of the existing quality measures that are based on distance ranking and K-ary neighborhoods.
- However, as the objective function is usually intended to be optimized by typical techniques such as gradient descent, it must fulﬁll some requirements as to continuity and differentiability.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Use when selecting DR reliability checks in workflow Step 3.
  - Use with complementary local/cluster/global metrics rather than a single score.
- Avoid when:
  - Avoid using this source as the only decision signal without task constraints.
- Failure modes:
  - Overfitting conclusions to a single metric family or benchmark setup.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `lcmc`: local neighborhood overlap quality
- `mrre`: rank-error behavior across neighborhood sizes
- `stress`: distance-fitting distortion objective/metric
- `tnc`: local neighborhood trustworthiness/continuity balance

# Implementation Notes
- Runtime/complexity signal: (2) Computing Q requires 2 N sorting operations and therefore the time complexity is OðN2 log NÞ with a typical sorting algorithm.
