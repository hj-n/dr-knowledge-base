# Problem
- 2.3 Quality Metrics and Scale Embedding a sufficiently complex high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space unavoidably causes distortion, which results in the loss of some information in the dataset [12].
- These distortions are difficult to detect visually and decrease the reliability of further analysis conducted on such DR embeddings.
- If the scale of one low-dimensional embedding is significantly smaller or larger than the scale of another low-dimensional embedding, this difference may lead to unreasonably high values of normalized stress, indicating poor preservation of the original high-dimensional data structure.
- The Shepard goodness score is then the Spearman rank correlation of the x and y components of the diagram, i.e., the smallest distance in high-dimensional space should still be the smallest in the projection, and the k smallest distance should still be the k smallest.
- RS is formally defined as follows, RS(X,P)= ∑ i,j [∆n(xi,x j)−∆ t (pi,p j)]2.(1) However, although raw stress is invariant under distortions such as rotations, translations, and reflections, it is variant under stretching and compression distortions [34].

# Method Summary
- Researchers typically evaluate the effectiveness of DR techniques such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [34, 59, 65] and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [67] using quantitative quality metrics.
- ABSTRACT Stress is among the most commonly employed quality metrics and optimization criteria for dimension reduction projections of highdimensional data.
- There are many quality metrics used to evaluate the distortion of a low-dimensional embedding, and they each differ in what exactly they compute.
- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [55] is another powerful non-linear method that uses manifold learning techniques for reducing dimensions.
- MDS directly optimizes the normalized stress function, so the stress score of the embedding generated should be low.
- Researchers have proposed different stress variants as objective functions to achieve this type of embedding.
- A new method of generalizing Sammon mapping with application to algorithm speedup.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Hence, without accounting for scale, one can establish any desired ordering between different DR techniques, making it crucial to take scale into account when comparing the performance of DR techniques to ensure that the quality metric used accurately reflects the performance of the techniques.
  - Although our results call into question the validity of evaluations made using scale-sensitive stress metrics, it still remains for future work to revisit other prior studies that used these metrics and verify their results.
  - 7 LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS ANDFUTUREWORK 7.1 Limitations While the experiments described here provide insights into the behavior of different stress metrics used to evaluate DR techniques, we acknowledge several limitations.
- Avoid when:
  - This measure ensures that the stress value is more sensitive to smaller discrepancies between the original and reduced distances, which can be crucial when measuring the preservation of the structure of the data during DR.
  - 2.3 Quality Metrics and Scale Embedding a sufficiently complex high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space unavoidably causes distortion, which results in the loss of some information in the dataset [12].
- Failure modes:
  - For this reason, we prefer to recommend scale-normalized stress for use in further DR evaluation, but any of the three scale-invariant metrics are preferable over the commonly used scale-sensitive measures.
  - We can easily see that the scale-sensitive metrics of raw stress and normalized stress fail to capture this expected ordering, only obtaining it less than 1% of the time.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `tnc`: Trustworthiness and Continuity behavior.
- `mrre`: mean relative rank errors across neighborhood scales.
- `nh`: label-based neighborhood hit.
- `nd`: neighbor-shape dissimilarity or neighbor distortion.
- `dsc`: distance consistency for class separation.
- `pr`: pairwise-distance correlation behavior.
- `srho`: rank-correlation of pairwise distances.
- `snc`: Steadiness/Cohesiveness inter-cluster reliability.
- `topo`: topology-related structure behavior.
- `proc`: Procrustes local shape agreement.

# Implementation Notes
- Finally, Experiment A does not account for potential variations in the performance of DR techniques due to hyperparameter settings or initialization conditions, which can influence the quality of DR techniques [14].
- Note that each of these embeddings was finely tuned with hyper-parameters to achieve good results, and the embeddings are at different scales.

- Hence, without accounting for scale, one can establish any desired ordering between different DR techniques, making it crucial to take scale into account when comparing the performance of DR techniques to ensure that the quality metric used accurately reflects the performance of the techniques.
- If the scale of one low-dimensional embedding is significantly smaller or larger than the scale of another low-dimensional embedding, this difference may lead to unreasonably high values of normalized stress, indicating poor preservation of the original high-dimensional data structure.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and random-seed protocol fixed when comparing methods.
