# Problem
- Stress is among the most commonly employed quality metrics and optimization criteria for dimension reduction projections of high- dimensional data.
- Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, bi- ology, and the social sciences.

# Method Summary
- “Normalized Stress" is Not Normalized: How to Interpret Stress Correctly Kiran Smelser*, Jacob Miller †, Stephen Kobourov ‡ University of Arizona 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Scale value 10 1 100 101 102 log(Normalized stress) Iris MDS Minimum t-SNE Minimum Random Minimum Iris dataset embedded with MDS Iris dataset embedded with t-SNE Iris dataset emb
- The plot (top) shows the values of thenormalized stressmetric for these three embeddings and clearly illustrates the sensitivity to scale.
- As one uniformly scales the embeddings to be larger or smaller, the value of normalized stress changes.
- Notably, at different scales, different embeddings have lower stress, including the absurd situation where the random embedding has the lowest stress (beyond scale 9).

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Use when comparing embeddings under explicit scale control.
  - Use scale-invariant variants when ranking methods across plots.
- Avoid when:
  - Avoid comparing raw normalized stress or raw KL-divergence values across arbitrary scales.
- Failure modes:
  - Mis-ranking methods due to embedding-scale artifacts.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `dsc`: class consistency/separation quality in embedding (label-separation-sensitive)
- `kl_div`: distribution mismatch in neighbor probabilities
- `mrre`: rank-error behavior across neighborhood sizes
- `sn_stress`: scale-normalized stress variant
- `snc`: inter-cluster reliability via steadiness/cohesiveness
- `srho`: rank-order agreement of pairwise relationships
- `stress`: distance-fitting distortion objective/metric
- `tnc`: local neighborhood trustworthiness/continuity balance

# Implementation Notes
- Fix or optimize embedding scale before comparing stress/KL-based scores across methods.
- If labels are weakly separated in original space, down-weight label-separation-sensitive metrics in final justification.
