# Problem
- The paper studies a core evaluation failure: normalized stress changes when an embedding is uniformly scaled, even though scaling does not change neighborhood structure or class arrangement.
- Because different DR methods naturally output embeddings at different scales, direct normalized-stress comparison can arbitrarily reorder methods.
- The authors frame this as a reliability problem for DR benchmarking, not just a numerical nuisance.

# Method Summary
- The paper provides analytical derivations and empirical experiments for five stress-family measures: raw stress, normalized stress, Shepard goodness score, non-metric stress, and the proposed scale-normalized stress (SNS).
- It proves raw stress and normalized stress are scale-sensitive, while Shepard goodness and non-metric stress are scale-invariant.
- It proposes SNS by minimizing normalized-stress-style residuals over a positive scale factor `alpha`, yielding an explicitly scale-invariant variant that preserves familiar stress interpretation.
- Evaluation is done on multiple datasets and several DR techniques (MDS, t-SNE, UMAP, LLE, Isomap, random embedding baselines) with repeated initializations.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - you compare embeddings produced at different native scales,
  - you need stress-family scores that cannot be manipulated by post-hoc resizing,
  - you want a drop-in alternative that stays close to normalized-stress intuition.
- Avoid when:
  - you only report scale-sensitive stress values without any explicit scale-control protocol.
- Failure modes:
  - normalized stress can make weak embeddings look better than strong ones after simple uniform scaling.

# Metrics Mentioned
- `stress`: central family under analysis; scale sensitivity is the key issue studied.
- `sn_stress`: proposed scale-normalized stress (SNS) to correct scale sensitivity.
- `nm_stress`: discussed as a scale-invariant alternative (Kruskal-type non-metric stress).
- `srho`: Shepard goodness score is treated as a rank-correlation-based, scale-invariant comparator.

# Implementation Notes
- Do not compare raw/normalized stress across methods unless scale is explicitly controlled or normalized out.
- If legacy pipelines depend on normalized stress, SNS is presented as a practical replacement requiring only one extra minimization over scale.
- The paper uses repeated random initializations and reports ranking frequencies; this is important because scale effects interact with optimization variability.

# Claim Atoms (For Conflict Resolution)
- CLAIM-ZR03-C1 | stance: support | summary: Normalized stress is scale-sensitive and can produce contradictory DR rankings. | evidence_ids: ZR03-E1, ZR03-E2, ZR03-E6
- CLAIM-ZR03-C2 | stance: support | summary: Scale-invariant stress-family alternatives (including non-metric stress and SNS) better reflect expected quality ordering. | evidence_ids: ZR03-E3, ZR03-E4, ZR03-E7
- CLAIM-ZR03-C3 | stance: support | summary: SNS is recommended as a practical correction when normalized stress is already used in workflows. | evidence_ids: ZR03-E5, ZR03-E8

# Workflow Relevance Map
- step: 3 | relevance: high | note: metric selection should prefer scale-invariant stress variants for distance-faithfulness tasks.
- step: 4 | relevance: high | note: deterministic scoring must prevent scale-manipulation artifacts during method ranking.
- step: 7 | relevance: medium | note: user-facing reports should disclose whether stress metrics are scale-sensitive or scale-invariant.
