# Problem
- The column 1 gives a pessimistic view of the DR techniques because when classes appear to overlap, the reader cannot tell whether the classes actually overlap in the data space or unduly overlap because of mapping distortions.
- Researchers who design new DR techniques attempt to demonstrate that their technique is immune enough to distortions for the considered user tasks, so to prevent the user from wrong inferences about the original data.
- As the low CCPC is only due to the mapping distortions because the CCCA is valid for all the displayed classes, the class-coloring evaluation of the DR techniques is trustworthy.
- Many papers in Machine Learning and Visualization communities proposed techniques to evaluate quantitatively or qualitatively these mapping distortions.

# Method Summary
- The DR techniques that we compare are: an axis-parallel projection onto the first 2 variables of the multidimensional data; the projection onto the first two Principal Components [10] of the data; a Curvilinear Component Analysis [4] with random initialization and PCA-based initialization; and an ISOMAP [19] with 5 and 10 nearest neighbors’ graph to compute the geodesic distances.
- Scatterplot ’s axes of standard axis-parallel projections or DR techniques like the projection pursuit [6] or the Principal Component Analysis [10], have a meaningful linear relationship to the original variables of the multidimensional data space.
- Otherwise, after reordering rows and columns using standard matrix reordering algorithms [ 15], it is possible to visually search for a clique as a square pattern along the diagonal of the heatmap representation of the matrix S.
- In (c), projecting the data of two classes on the line (plain black) joining their means (large circles) enables to ensure that they are linearly separable if the line intervals containing these projections do not overlap.
- In this paper , we raise an important issue concerning the userbased evaluation of these DR visualization techniques and we propose a principled solution and guidelines to sanitize this evaluation process.
- The mean-line test algorithm has a O(DNC²) time complexity and O(DNC²) memory complexity, where N is the total number of data, D is the dimension of the data vector space E and C is the number of classes.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - The former is a visual perception mechanism that the reader will use without knowing it, but the latter is an assumption that must be validated regarding the data either prior to the use of the dimension reduction technique or as a necessary complement to avoid underestimation of the quality of the maps obtained.
  - Therefore there are three ways to deal with the reference data: - Case A - Map all classes but ignore non-reference ones: all the available data can be mapped with the DR technique but the ones not assigned to the reference classes shall not be ignored for the evaluation , so the user shall be warned and put in position to properly evaluate the mapping by mentally masking non-reference classes .
- Avoid when:
  - Sanity Check for Class-coloring-based Evaluation of Dimension Reduction techniques Michaël Aupetit Qatar Computing Research Institute 10th Floor, Tornado Tower, PO Box 5825, Doha, Qatar (+974) 445 47150 michael.aupetit@qf.org.qa ABSTRACT Dimension Reduction techniques used to visualize multidimensional data provide a scatterplot spatialization of data similarities.
  - Not applying this sanity check process prior to the class-coloring evaluation would question the usefulness of ever displaying the bare meaningless-axes class-colored maps for this sake, as the reader is utterly unable to know whether the patterns she visualiz es characterize only the data, only their mapping or both of them.
- Failure modes:
  - Although more dedicated controlled experiments on DR visual evaluation processes are still missing in the literature, the CCPC is commonly used in DR research papers as a basis to call the reader as a witness to qualify DR results by putting themselves in the hypothesized position of the end-user .

# Implementation Notes
- The DR techniques that we compare are: an axis-parallel projection onto the first 2 variables of the multidimensional data; the projection onto the first two Principal Components [10] of the data; a Curvilinear Component Analysis [4] with random initialization and PCA-based initialization; and an ISOMAP [19] with 5 and 10 nearest neighbors’ graph to compute the geodesic distances.
- All of them can tell when two classes are linearly separable, but they have limits either not converging when classes are not linearly separable, or being too complex to compute or too complex to program with metaparameters to be tuned arbitrarily.
- Scatterplot ’s axes of standard axis-parallel projections or DR techniques like the projection pursuit [6] or the Principal Component Analysis [10], have a meaningful linear relationship to the original variables of the multidimensional data space.
- Otherwise, after reordering rows and columns using standard matrix reordering algorithms [ 15], it is possible to visually search for a clique as a square pattern along the diagonal of the heatmap representation of the matrix S.
- In (c), projecting the data of two classes on the line (plain black) joining their means (large circles) enables to ensure that they are linearly separable if the line intervals containing these projections do not overlap.
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
