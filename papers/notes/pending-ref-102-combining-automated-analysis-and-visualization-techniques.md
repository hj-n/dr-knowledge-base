# Problem
- The visualization of large complex information spaces typically involves mapping high-dimensional data la lower-dimensional visual representations. l'he challenge for the analyst is to find an insightful mapping, while the dimensionality of the data, and consequently the number of possible mappings increases.
- 3 OVERVtEW AND PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Increasing dimensionality and growing volumes of data lead to the necessity of effective exploration techniques to present the hidden information and structures of high-dimensional datasets .
- The problem with this approach is that an extensive exploration of a high-dimensional dataset is effortful and time consuming .
- This projection is ranked with the ID·HDM: HDMJD I 100- Z DL.PcH (p)) x c (7) where ~ is a normalization factor , to obtain ranking values between o and lOO. having 100 as best value: lOO Z /o82MLL cPc' (9) [n some datasets. paraxial projections are not able to show the structure of high-dimensional data. [n these cases, simple rotation of the projection axes can improve the quality of the measure.

# Method Summary
- Methods are needed that help the user automatically find effective and expressive visualizations_ In this paper we present an automated approach that supports the user in the exploration process.
- As an alternative to the method s for dimension reordering for Parallel Coordinates we propose a method based on the structure presented on the low-dimensional embeddings of the dataset.
- 2 RELATED W ORK In the last years several approaches for selecting good views of high-dimensional projections and embeddings have been proposed.
- Our measures first select the best projections of the dataset and therefore have the advantage. over embeddings generated by linear combination of the the original variables. that the orthogonal projection axes can be more easily interpretcd by the user.
- In this section we propose two approaches to rank the scatterplots of multiv ariate classified datasets , in order to determine the best views of the high-dimensional structures.
- This low-dimensional embedding of the high-dimensional data in a 20 view can be interpreted easily. especially in the most common case of orthogonal linear projections.
- 7 CONCLUSION In this paper we presented severa l methods to aid and potentially speed up thc visual exploration process for different visualization techniqucs.

# When To Use / Not Use
- Use when:
  - Exhaustively computing all n-dimen sional combinations in order to choose the best/worst ones, requires a very long computation time and becomes unfeasible for a large 11 . [n these cases, in order to search for the best /I-dimensional combinations in 3 feasible time. an algorithm to solve a Traveling Salesman Problem is used. c.g. the A *-Search algorithm [81 or others [2] .
  - Our measures first select the best projections of the dataset and therefore have the advantage. over embeddings generated by linear combination of the the original variables. that the orthogonal projection axes can be more easily interpretcd by the user.
- Avoid when:
  - They also use image-analysis tec.hniques to rank the different lower-dimen sional views of the dataset and present only the best to the user.
  - This projection is ranked with the ID·HDM: HDMJD I 100- Z DL.PcH (p)) x c (7) where ~ is a normalization factor , to obtain ranking values between o and lOO. having 100 as best value: lOO Z /o82MLL cPc' (9) [n some datasets. paraxial projections are not able to show the structure of high-dimensional data. [n these cases, simple rotation of the projection axes can improve the quality of the measure.
- Failure modes:
  - Other density estimations could of course be used as well Visualizations containing good correlations should, in general, havo:: corresponding density fields with a small band of larger values. while views with less correlation have a density field consisting of many local maxima spread in the image .

# Metrics Mentioned
- `neighborhood-preservation criteria`: referenced as part of projection-quality or reliability assessment.
- `rank-based quality criteria`: referenced as part of projection-quality or reliability assessment.

# Implementation Notes
- Straight lines in the image space can be described as y = ax + b.The main idea of the Hou gh transform is to define a straight line according to its parameters, i,e, the slope a and the interception b.
- This work was supported in part by a grant from the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the strategic research initiative on Scalable Visual Analyties.
- The method provides to the user not only valuable lower-dimensional projections. but also optimized parameter settings for pixel-Ievel visualizations .
- An intersection of these curves indicates that the corresponding pixels belong to the line defined by the parameters (Pi, ei) in the original space .
- Keep preprocessing, initialization policy, and seed protocol fixed when comparing methods or parameter settings.
